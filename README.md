Hello my name is Francisco, I worked at Ameritex last year before leaving to learn web development. I really enjoyed working with your company and was hoping that I could continue working with you, but this time as a web developer.So I took it upon myself to show you proof of what I am capable of. This is a demo website I built using Next Js and a few other libraries and its built to function look and function like your website. You can find the demo here --link and the git repo her --link. Anyways i hope i didn't cross any boundaries by using your assets and I will shutdown the demo as soon as you have had a chance to see it. Thank you for you time.
