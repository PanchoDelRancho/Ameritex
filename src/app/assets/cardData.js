    details:
      "Due to an efficient automatic loading and unloading system, the productivity of the LT8 is unparalleled. The automatic nesting software, combined with the reduced end bar scrap, helps to exploit the available material. Our BLM LT8 excels as the most flexible and precise structural cutting machine on the market. Equipped with a tilting head, it allows 3D cutting on all sections, including open and special profiles. It can cut tube diameters from ½” to 8” and a bar weight up to 24Lb/FT. For heavier structural cutting applications, we have added a Mazak Fabrigear 400 III allowing us to cut materials with wall thicknesses approaching 3/4″ and pipe up to 16″ diameter.",
